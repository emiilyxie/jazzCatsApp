 # Welcome to JazzCats!

 JazzCats is a music game to practice music transcription. It's also cat themed :)
 
 Why transcribe music?
 
 Transcription is an essential skill for jazz musicians (or even all musicians). It allows musicians to immediately know what they're listening to so that they can compose charts or improvise solos quickly and efficiently.
 
 However, transcription requires a solid grasp on ear training and takes much time, often making it a difficult and sometimes frustrating process. In order to make this process more exciting and accessible to beginners, I've created JazzCats!
 
 Now, let's get started with Level 1.
